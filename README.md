Assignment 1:
The purpose of my application is to help toy collectors keep their collections organized in one central spot while being able to input the price the consumer 
paid for each toy as well as how much it sells online. The most common issue with any collector app is that the apps are specified by toy brands, meaning 
consumers will have to download multiple different apps in order to virtualize their entire collections. The way I have designed my app is that you are able 
to add any toy into a generic input sheet.

Assignment 2:
I changed up my design a bit from my initial layout. Firstly, I changed the backgrounds of all activities to be more related artwork, opposed to generic 
background colours. I took out the sorting function at the top of the gallery and replaced it with a next page button. I had planned to add photos in the 
gallery for their prompts however I could never get it to function proprely. I left in the add photo button in hopes of getting it to work eventually.

Assignment 3:
I have made minor changes since Assignment 2 as I believe my UI to be clear and easy to use. I have formatted my application a little more since the last
assignment, adding more spacing and constraits to the design. I have added a launcher icon and secured my database so that it is no longer public. I have uploaded
my app to the google play store however am still pending approval for my release.
